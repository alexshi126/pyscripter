# Introduction to PyScripter

PyScripter originally started as a lightweight  IDE designed to to serve the purpose of providing 
a strong scripting solution  for Delphi applications, complementing the excellent 
[Python for Delphi](https://github.com/pyscripter/python4delphi) (P4D) components. 
 However, and with the encouragement of the P4D creator Morgan Martinez and a 
 few early users, it has now evolved into a full-featured stand-alone Python 
 IDE. It is built in [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) using P4D and the
[SynEdit](https://github.com/pyscripter/SynEdit) component, but is extensible 
 using Python scripts. Currently, it is only available for Microsoft Windows 
 operating systems and features a modern user-interface. Being built in 
 a compiled language is rather snappier than some of the other IDEs
 and provides an extensive blend of [features](mainfeatures) 
 that make it a productive Python development environment.

*Why yet another Python IDE?* 

There are many [Python](http://www.python.org)  Integrated Development Environments around.
And quite a few good ones, for example [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/), 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  and 
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), 
 not to mention IDLE which is included in the standard Python distribution.
 So it is reasonable to ask why bother to develop yet another Python IDE.
 The short answer is for the fun of it! The long answer relates to the 
 ambition to create a Python IDE that is competitive with commercial Windows-based 
 IDEs available for other languages.
