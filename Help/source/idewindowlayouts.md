# IDE Window Layouts

You can save a layout of the IDE windows under a name of your choice so that you can later 
restore this layout. What is saved is the visibility, docking position and size of each IDE window and the size and position of the main window. This is done via the Layouts submenu of the [View menu](viewmenu) and the corresponding View toobar button. For example you make create different layouts for editing scripts, debugging and Unit Testing.

**The Debug layout** 
 
If a layout named 'Debug' is available when you start debugging, then this layout is loaded. 
When debugging terminates the layout active before starting debugging is restored. You can 
save the current layout under the name 'Debug ' by using the "Set Debug Layout" command of 
the View|Layouts menu.  

***Note:***\
Switching layouts at the start of debugging introduces a delay which you may want to prevent. To 
avoid the switching of IDE Window layouts when debugging, just delete the layout named 
'Debug'.
