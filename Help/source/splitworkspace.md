# Split Workspace

You initiate side-by-side file editing by using the "Split Workspace" commands 
of the [View menu](viewmenu). These commands add a second set of editor tabs to achieve a 
layout such as the following:

![graphic](images/side-by-side-file-editing1.JPG){align=center width="38.38em" height="26.31em"}

You can also show two files side-by-side one above the other (horizontally aligned).

You can add tabs to he secondary workspace in a number of ways: 

- Drag & drop tabs from the primary Workspace (also works in the opposite direction).
- Open files while the secondary Workspace is active.
- Use the Recent Files menu while the secondary Workspace is active.
- Use the context menu of the secondary Workspace to create new modules.

When you hide the secondary editor Workspace all contained tabs are moved to the primary tab 
set. If you just want to maximize the editing space of the primary Workspace you 
can temporarily hide the secondary tabs by double-clicking the handle of the 
splitter between the two tab sets. You can later restore the previous 
layout by double-clicking the handle of the splitter again.

The layout of the secondary Workspace and the contained tabs are persisted across PyScripter 
invocations.
