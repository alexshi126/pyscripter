# Window Docking

The docking features of PyScripter resemble those found in Visual Studio 2003 and later. 
PyScripter provides you with a various Window Docking capabilities. Few of them are:

- You can undock forms by double clicking either on the window header bar or on the 
  tab of a form.
- You can dock forms on the sides of the main window or inside one-another by dragging 
  and dropping.
- You can unpin forms and minimize the space they occupy by clicking on the pin button 
  of the window header bar.
- You can hide forms by clicking on the close button of the window header bar.
- You can rearrange tab-docked forms by dragging and dropping the tabs

In the picture  below you see three different forms of docking. They are:
- At the bottom multiple windows are docked in tabbed form.
- At the left-hand side, two tabbed windows - File Explorer and Project Explorer 
  are docked.
- On the right-hand side the Code Explorer window has been "unpinned" and 
  hidden in order to occupy minimal space.
