# Editor Fonts

Pyscripter requires the use of monospace or non-proportional fonts.
If you find the choice of fonts available in your Windows system limited
you may want to have a look at [Programming Fonts](https://www.programmingfonts.org/).
Microsoft, in addition to Consolas has also produced a new attractive monospace font called
Cascadia Code, which became available with Windows 10.

And by the way if you are using an LCD screen you may want to turn  ClearType on.
You can fine tune ClearType using the "ClearType Text Tuner" Windows utilty.
Clear Type can make a huge difference!

## Font Ligatures

Font ligatures are special characters that combines two (or sometimes
three) characters into a single character. Certain fonts such as Fira
Code and Cascadia Code, provide ligatures that are useful in programming
contexts, e.g. instead of displaying >= they display a single character â‰¥.
PyScripter supports the display of such ligatures when a suitable font is used and the
"Show font ligatures" [editor option](editoroptions) is enabled.
