# The Messages Window

The Messages Window serves the purpose of logging and displaying to the user syntax and 
runtime errors, Python tracebacks information and other warnings and messages. If there is 
File location information in a message you display that file and move the cursor to the 
respective position by double-clicking on that message. A history of up to 10 messages logs 
is maintained and you can browse through those message logs by using the arrow buttons at 
the top right-hand side of the window or the context menu.
