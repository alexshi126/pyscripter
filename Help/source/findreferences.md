# Find References

This utility function allows you to find all references of the identifier under the cursor, 
even if they are in different files. All files in the same directory as 
the file in the current editor are searched. In addition if the Python 
module belongs to a package all the files of that package are searched as well. 
This feature can be invoked from the [Search menu](searchmenu). 
PyScripter provides detailed feedback on the found references in the 
[Messages Window](messageswindow) and it reports any problems that may have occurred.
